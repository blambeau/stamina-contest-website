<h4>Download test set</h4>

<p>Go to the @{download}{download page} and click on the problem number in the test set grid.</p>

<p>A test set for a given problem is a text file containing one string on each line (see example below). All test strings start with a '?' meaning that it has to be labeled as positive or negative by the competitor.</p>

<pre class="left">
? 1 7 23 2 1 7 0
? 0 8 3
...
</pre>

<p>Don't forget that empty string (containing no symbol at all) exists. Therefore, the following line may appear in a test set:</p>

<pre class="left">
?
</pre>

<input type="button" onclick="javascript:hide_popup()" value="Close"/>
