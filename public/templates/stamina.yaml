description: |-
  The STAMINA (STAte Machine INference Approaches) competition aims to identify the best technique for
  learning deterministic finite state machines. It extends former competitions, especially Abbadingo,
  and focusses on the complexity of the learning with respect to the alphabet size. Stamina relies on
  original generation protocols for target machines and learning samples. It aims to encourage the
  development of novel learning algorithms and to encourage cross-fertilization between the machine
  learning and software engineering communities. A prize of Â£700 (about $1146) will be awarded to the
  winner.
